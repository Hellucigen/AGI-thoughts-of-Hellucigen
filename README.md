This repository hosts a research-oriented framework for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), designed with a human-like cognitive flow in mind. The framework aims to enable free association, non-linear reasoning, autonomous goal generation, and continuous learning, providing a foundation for experimental and theoretical studies in next-generation intelligent systems.

Why this framework?
It combines cognitive inspiration from human thinking with practical implementability. The system is capable of autonomous hypothesis generation, dynamic task planning, and continuous self-optimization. It balances theoretical rigor with hands-on experimentation potential.

Core Components:

Knowledge Graph: Dynamic representation of entities, concepts, and actions. Includes an axiom library (facts and logic) and a personalized memory library (experience, perception, emotions). Supports reasoning jumps and adaptive knowledge evolution.

Sliding Attention: Simulates cognitive sliding through embedding spaces, guided by semantic similarity, memory entropy, emotion weighting, and rule associations. Enables long-range associations and hierarchical task coordination.

Perception Module: Integrates multimodal inputs (vision, auditory, tactile, taste, smell) into knowledge nodes. Prioritizes novel and high-entropy information. Feedback loops enhance sensitivity and memory formation.

Intrinsic Thinking: Autonomous generation of hypotheses, graph expansion, and cognitive style shaping. Involves self-sampling, emotion modulation, high-entropy activation, fuzzy associations, and evolving task chains.

What you can do with this repository:
